<p>I am an incoming PhD student at UT Austin, joining in Fall 2022, where I will be working with <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/neeraja/">Neeraja Yadwadkar</a>. </p>

<p>Currently, I am working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research India</a>. My work lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Accessibility with a focus on making all kinds of printed content accessible to people with print-impairment. I am a part of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/people/">Technology and Empowerment</a> group. </p>

<p>I am broadly interested in the area of Systems and Machine Learning with a motivation to build technology towards societal impact.</p>

<p>Before, I had been a Research Fellow and ML Engineer at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org">Wadhwani AI</a>, an independent, non-profit research instutite. I worked on developing AI-based systems for societal impact. Besides, I also developed an internal ML platform for orchestration and scheduling of large-scale ML jobs.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in">IIT Guwahati</a> in 2019 with a major in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. During my undergraduate, I enjoyed my summers at Hanyang University, South Korea, and NVIDIA.</p>

<p>My CV can be found <a href="../resume/">here</a>.</p>
