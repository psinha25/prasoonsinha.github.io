<p>I am a first year ECE PhD student at UT Austin 🤘 advised by Professor <a
        href="https://sites.utexas.edu/neeraja/">Neeraja Yadwadkar</a>. I obtained my BS in Computer Engineering &
    Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison,
    where I was fortunate to be co-advised by Professors <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sinclair/">Matt
        Sinclair</a> and <a href="https://shivaram.org/">Shivaram Venkataraman</a>.</p>

<p> Broadly, my research interests are in Computer Systems and Architecture, with a focus in cloud computing. I am
    interested in improving the efficacy of large-scale systems, such as cloud and datacenters, for future applications.
    At the same time, I have a
    particular interest in considering the environmental impacts of large-scale systems. Hence, I plan to research how
    we can make cloud computing a more sustainable technology.

<p>My CV can be found <a href="../resume/">here</a>.</p>
