<p>I am currently a Researh Engineer at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research India</a>, working on digitizing printed content for accessibility. I am a part of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/people/">Technology and Empowerment</a> group. My work lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Accessibility. </p>

<p>Before, I had been a Research Fellow and ML Engineer at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org">Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, an independent, non-profit research instutite. I worked on developing AI-based systems for societal impact. Besides, I also developed an internal ML platform for orchestration and scheduling of large-scale ML jobs.</p>

<p>I graduated with major in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in">IIT Guwahati</a> in 2019. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/">Dr. Ashish Anand</a> on using deep learning to compress long strands of DNA information into meaningful lower dimension features and identify signals or motifs which influence the splicing phenomenon. This work was accepted at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/icml-compbio-2019/home">ICML 2019 Workshop on Computational Biology</a>.</p>
<p>I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Vision, ML Engineering and Computer Systems.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate, I have worked on Image Contrast Enhancement in an internship at Computational Vision and Fuzzy Systems Lab, Hanyang University, South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee. I also spent a summer at NVIDIA working with the GPU Performance Verification Team on improving latency analysis in the performance simulation environment.</p>
<p>My CV can be found <a href="../resume/">here</a>.</p>
