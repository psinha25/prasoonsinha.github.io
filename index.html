<p>I am a first year ECE PhD student at UT Austin ü§ò advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/neeraja/">Neeraja Yadwadkar</a>. I obtained my BS in Computer Engineering & Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, 
where I was fortunate to be co-advised by Professors <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sinclair/">Matt Sinclair</a> and <a href="https://shivaram.org/">Shivaram Venkataraman</a>.</p>

<p> Broadly, my research interests are in Computer Systems and Architecture, with a focus in cloud computing. I am interested in improving the efficacy of large-scale systems like cloud for future applications. At the same time, I have a 
    particular interest in considering the environmental impacts of large-scale systems. Hence, I plan to research how we can make cloud computing a more sustainable technology. 

<p>My CV can be found <a href="../resume/">here</a>.</p>
